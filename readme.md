# Covid-19 Screening Tool Automation

A selenium project that automates the Ontario Government's Covid-19 screening tool. This software should not be used to avoid covid screening questions but rather as a tool to see how selenium works at a basic level

NOTE: As the Ontario Government updates the screening tool the bot will most certainly break as it is not programmed dynamically. Each update to the screening tool requires the bot to be updated as well.
